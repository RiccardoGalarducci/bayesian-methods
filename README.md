# Bayesian Methods

This repository contains the **Bayesian Methods project** developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

The aim of the project is to solve two assignments using the statistical software R.

### Exercise 1
The first task of the project is to tackle a multiple regression problem. The dataset contains information on real estate transactions. The goal is to predict the target variable $Y$ House Price per square feet using the other variables that constitute the dataset.
Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) are exploited to fit the model for regression.


### Exercise 2
In the second exercise the dataset reports biological experiments where plants were planted on 7 different sites with different soil characteristics. The goal is to chose an adequate bayesian model to model the plant height. The aforementioned model has been fit using Monte Carlo Markov Chains.


## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the report and two R scripts which contains the code for the two exercises, the dataset provided in csv files and the two assignments.
